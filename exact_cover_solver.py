        all the comments are here to describe what was going in my head and as a note for myself in the future when I want to revisit it. 
        Most notations come from knuth's Vol 4 fascile 5, section 7.2.2.1. If I borrow a notation, I'll denote it with a (*)

        first we need to change the representation of the data to easily check the row, column and box to check if we can put a valid number
        so we will use 3 dictionaries to represent the number in a cell
        we need to make the following:      P(i, j), r(i, k), c(j, k), b(x, k)           (*)            
        The i, j, k, and x are originally subscripts in Knuth's book, but since there's no subscripts, Im representing them as parameters
        - k is the number that goes in a cell of a sudoku board 1 <= k <= n
        - i, j are the row and column indices, 0 <= i, j < n 
        - x is the box number, starting from the top left and ends at the bottom right, 0 <= x < n

        | dict name | stored value    |
        |-----------|-----------------|
        |  P(i, j)  |    set of k     |    - P(i, j) stores a set of all numbers that can be stored in the cell (i, j)
        |  r(i, k)  |    set of j     |    - r(i, k) stores a set of row indices where the number k can be stored in column i 
        |  c(j, k)  |    set of i     |    - c(j, k) stores a set of row indices where the number k can be stored in row j
        |  b(x, k)  |  set of (i, j)  |    - b(x, k) stores a set of positions which the number k can be stored in within that box
    
        initializing p, r, c, and b, each with n^2 pairs and each associated value is a list of numbers 0 through n-1
        each dictionary should be of size n*n and there are 4 of them, so we have 4*n*n, for a 9x9 sudoku board we have 4*9*9, which is 324 items

        Every sudoku board is solvable using exact covers, and the number of covers to make is n^3
        it's n^3 because for every n^2 cells, we have n numbers that are candidates for that cell, for a normal sudoku we have 9^3 covers, which is 729 covers.
